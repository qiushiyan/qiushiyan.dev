## About me

I am currently a fullstack engineer working on LLM-related products. I migrated from a data science role to the engineering side.

## Technologies

Things I have professional experience with for more than 1 year.

- **Frontend development**: My main stack is Next.js, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM.

- **API development**: I have created a couple of APIs in Python (FastAPI) and TypeScript (Nest.js and Hono).

- **Data pipelines**: I love tidyverse, data.table and Quarto! In Python I mostly use Pandas and Airflow.

- **R package and Shiny app development**

Tools I have experience with but haven't used professionally.

- **WebAssembly**

- **Go**

## I want to learn

- [ ] **React Native**: (in progress) I want to develop some LLM-related cross-platform apps and experiment with the monorepo experience. How sharable can the codebase be among Electron, React Native, and a web framework (I will probably be using Remix)?

- [ ] **More Rust** : (in progress) I used to create a couple of CLIs in Rust for automating some workflows. I also want to create rust-based toolings for JavaScript, Python and R.

- [ ] **Elixir and Phoenix**: I have touched on Elixir a bit and really like the language. I heard there are interesting things happening in the ecosystem: the new type system, LiveView updates, etc. I don't think I'll migrate off TypeScript for web development any time soon, but it would be interesting to see what the developer experience in Elixir/Phoenix is like.

- [ ] **3D on the web**: probably using three.js.

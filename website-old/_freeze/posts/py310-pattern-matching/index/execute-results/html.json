It takes as input an object to inspect (following `match`), and multiple patterns to match against (following one or more `case`). If there is a match, a pattern-specific code block runs. The basic syntax is\n\n<!-- ```{r, include = FALSE}\nymisc::set_knitr_options()\nlibrary(reticulate)\nSys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.10/3.10.5/bin/python3\")\n``` -->\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nerror_code = 403\nmatch error_code:\n    case 400:\n        print(\"Bad request\")\n    case 403:\n        print(\"Unauthorized\")\n    case 500:\n        print(\"Internal server error\")\n    case _:\n        print(\"Something's wrong with the Internet\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nUnauthorized\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, we check case by case if `error_code` is equal to a value, if it's not one of 400, 403, 500, `_` will be a catch-all wildcard. Also, pattern matching will break when it hits a match, so each `case` should be independent.\n\n\n\nTo run examples in this article, be sure you are using python higher than 3.10. To check, use\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport sys\nsys.version\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=26}\n```\n'3.10.8 (main, Oct 13 2022, 09:48:40) [Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.102)]'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Switch statements\n\nThe most apparent usage of pattern matching is implementing `swich ... case` statements in many other programming languages, which is a replacement for multiple if else statements.  Imagine in some game app we could will have a `move` class method which controls figure movement\n\n```python\ndef move(self, direction):\n    match direction:\n        case \"up\":\n            self.move_up()\n        case \"down\":\n            self.move_down()\n        case \"left\":\n            self.move_left()\n        case \"right\":\n            self.move_right()\n```\n\n## Object destructuring\n\nThe real power of pattern matching resides in destructuring data structures like lists and dictionaries.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmatch {\"first_name\": \"Jane\", \"last_name\": \"Doe\", \"middle_name\": \"\"}:\n    case {\"first_name\": first_name , \"last_name\": last_name}:\n        print(first_name, last_name)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nJane Doe\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the example above, we supplied a pattern that says the object should contains keys \"first_name\" and \"last_name\", if the pattern matches, their values will be captured into the variables `first_name` and `last_name`. Note that for an dictionary, structural pattern matching matches the structure instead of the exact content, the pattern is valid as long as \"first_name\" and \"last_name\" exists in the object's keys, and we don't have to worry about the unmentioned \"middle_name\".\n\nFor a more advanced example, suppose we are working with the [SpaceX API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/) to retrieve launch data, an individual record of launch looks like\n\n```json\n{\n        \"flight_number\": 1,\n        \"mission_name\": \"FalconSat\",\n        \"upcoming\": false,\n        \"launch_year\": \"2006\",\n        \"launch_date_unix\": 1143239400,\n        \"rocket\": {\n            \"rocket_id\": \"falcon1\",\n            \"rocket_name\": \"Falcon 1\",\n        },\n        \"details\": \"Engine failure at 33 seconds and loss of vehicle\",\n        //... other fields\n}\n```\n\nWe only want to get the fields `mission_name`, `rocket_name` and `details`. Note that\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom pprint import pp\nres = requests.get(\"https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches?limit=3\")\ndata = res.json()\nout = []\nfor launch in data:\n    match launch:\n        case {\"mission_name\": mname, \"rocket\": {\"rocket_name\": rname}, \"details\": details}:\n            out.append({\"mission_name\": mname, \"rocket_name\": rname, \"details\": details})\n\npp(out)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[{'mission_name': 'FalconSat',\n  'rocket_name': 'Falcon 1',\n  'details': 'Engine failure at 33 seconds and loss of vehicle'},\n {'mission_name': 'DemoSat',\n  'rocket_name': 'Falcon 1',\n  'details': 'Successful first stage burn and transition to second stage, '\n             'maximum altitude 289 km, Premature engine shutdown at T+7 min 30 '\n             's, Failed to reach orbit, Failed to recover first stage'},\n {'mission_name': 'Trailblazer',\n  'rocket_name': 'Falcon 1',\n  'details': 'Residual stage 1 thrust led to collision between stage 1 and '\n             'stage 2'}]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, not only are we matching top level key `mission_name` and `details`, we also use a nested pattern to extract rocket name.\n\nList is another common data structure for this sort of extraction.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmatch [1, 2, 3]:\n    case [1, 2]:\n        print(\"match 1\")\n    case [2, *rest]:\n        print(\"match 2\")\n        print(rest)\n    case[*other, last]:\n        print(\"match 3\")\n        print(last)\n        print(other)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nmatch 3\n3\n[1, 2]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI mentioned that pattern matching for dict does not require use to explicitly declare all fields. For lists this is different, we have to declare all elements, this is why match 1 fails. Match 2 attempts to use the `*` syntax to capture all values after 2 into a list called `rest`. This is helpful in case the list is really large and it's impossible to exhaust all elements, or we simply don't care about some elements. However, the second pattern does not specify the correct order, as 2 is not the first element in the matching object. Match 3 captures all elements but the last into `other`, and assign the last element to `last`.\n\n\nIt's also possible to do `or` logic with `|` in case statement. For example we may add a `case 401 | 403 | 404: \"Not allowed\"` statement to our first example. Here is another example from pep:\n\n```python\nmatch command.split():\n    ... # Other cases\n    case [\"north\"] | [\"go\", \"north\"]:\n        current_room = current_room.neighbor(\"north\")\n    case [\"get\", obj] | [\"pick\", \"up\", obj] | [\"pick\", obj, \"up\"]:\n        ... # Code for picking up the given object\n```\n\nLiteral patterns can also be captured using the `as` keyword\n\n```python\nmatch command.split():\n    case [\"go\", (\"north\" | \"south\" | \"east\" | \"west\") as direction]:\n        current_room = current_room.neighbor(direction)\n```\n\n## Adding conditions\n\nPattern matching allows if conditions the same way as list comprehension, we can append a `if ... else` clause like so\n\n\n```python\nall_directions = [\"up\", \"down\"]\n\nmatch commad.split():\n    case [\"go\", direction] if direction in all_directions:\n        move(direction)\n    case [\"go\", _]:\n        print(\"direction not supported\")\n```\n\n\nFor conditions that checks if an object is of a data type, we can directly use the class creator function:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef sum_list(numbers):\n    match numbers:\n        case []:\n            return 0\n        case [int(first) | float(first), *rest]:\n            return first + sum_list(rest)\n        case _:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Can only sum lists of numbers\")\n\nsum_list([1, 2, 3])\nsum_list([1, \"2\", 3])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nValueError: Can only sum lists of numbers\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere `int(first) | float(first)` checks if the first element is an integer or float. The next example uses a `dataclass` based pattern as well as its attributes\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Point:\n    x: float\n    y: float\n\np = Point(x = 1, y = 1)\n# data class for validation\nmatch p:\n    case Point(x = x):\n        print(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn general, we can use any python class for such validation. This is also called a **class pattern**.\n\n## Matching constants\n\nCare should be taken when matching constants, since it's common to store the constant in an variable and then use it in `case`. The following code will not work:\n\n```python\ndirection = \"up\"\n\nmatch \"down\":\n    case direction:\n        print(\"match\")\n    case _:\n        print(\"no match\")\n```\n\nWe are trying to match the value \"up\", but python interprets it as a capture pattern that says store whatever the match object is into the variable `direction`, so we are effectively overriding `direction` (recall the list matching example) and the first case always matches. Python will not allow this with an error message `SyntaxError: name capture 'direction' makes remaining patterns unreachable`.\n\nAs an alternative to match literal values, we can use a enum type for constant matching instead\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport enum\nclass Direction(str, enum.Enum):\n    up = \"up\"\n    down = \"down\"\n\nmatch \"down\":\n    case Direction.up:\n        print(\"match 1\")\n    case Direction.down:\n        print(\"match 2\")\n    case _:\n        print(\"match 3\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nmatch 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
